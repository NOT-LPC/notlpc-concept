The LPC is a committee of pharmacy contractors from the North of Tyne area that has been approved (often referred 
to as “recognised”) by NHS England under the NHS Act 2006 as the body representing the owners of the community 
pharmacies in the North of Tyne area. The area of an LPC is defined by the local authority boundaries specified 
in the [LPC Constitution](/about/our-constitution).
  
There is only one LPC in the North of Tyne area but similar representaive committees for doctors, dentists and opticians.  

The [LPC Constitution](/about/our-constitution) is specific to the LPC and is approved by the contractors represented by the 
LPC and accepted by NHS England as part of the LPC recognition process. The LPC can only act within the powers given by the constitution.  

Regulations under the NHS Act require NHS England to consult the LPC on matters such as market entry and local 
enhanced services so giving certain powers to LPCs. The Act also provides that NHS England may deduct money (the LPC levy) 
from the remuneration of contractors represented by the LPC to defray the committees’ administrative expenses.  

The [LPC Constitution](/about/our-constitution) sets out the duties of the LPC that include representing their contractors in local and national 
consultations relevant to pharmacy contractors; making representations to NHS England, Health and WellBeing Boards 
and PSNC; providing support, resources and guidance to pharmacy contractors; and ensuring committee business is 
carried out effectively and efficiently.  

The LPC may also provide support to contractors on contract compliance and monitoring, market entry and support local 
enhanced services and where appropriate other locally commissioned services; promote local pharmacy through local 
public relations and lobbying to create an environment for community pharmacy to flourish.  

The LPCs is therefore a committee with statutory powers and is highly influential. We are a local leadership body
representing, promoting and supporting the community pharmacies that we serve.  
 
We represent the following community pharmacies:
