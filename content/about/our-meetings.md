Community pharmacy contractors are welcome to observe our meetings.  

Typically, we review progress with local commissioning, receive guests from Area Teams and other NHS and 
Local Authority personnel, consider new local services opportunities, deal with contract applications, discuss 
the progress of work carried out by the LPC Chief Officer, review the budget and management accounts, review 
the business plan, deal with local issues affecting contractors or matters referred to the LPC by contractors.  
The LPC meeting is usually an informative and enjoyable day with the chance to discuss a range of things with other
local contractors.  See our [Minutes of Meetings](/about/minutes-of-meetings) for more information.

If you would like to attend a committee meeting, please email [lpc@northoftynelpc.com](mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com).
