# Northumberland

North of Tyne LPC does not support the Northumberland Stop Smoking Pharmacy Direct service specification.  Interested pharmacies should contact Northumberland County Council, Public Health Department.  Pharmacies already delivering this service should note that there is no obligation under the NHS Contractual Framework to make a supply against a NRT voucher. Pharmacies should also note that the 90p reimbursement per voucher is less than the NHS Single Activity Fee (currently set at £1.25 per item) and involves additional work submitting a claim via the Northumberland County Council web portal.  As seen from the Newcastle and North Tyneside service specifications, they pay a £2.00 fee per item for supply against a NRT voucher.  Most clients would receive two NRT items per voucher so a prescription would generate £2.50 in activity fee and other areas would pay £4 against a single 90p fee offered by Northumberland County Council.
