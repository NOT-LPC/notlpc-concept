# Northumberland

North of Tyne LPC does not support the Northumberland Stop Smoking Pharmacy Direct service specification.  Interested pharmacies should contact Northumberland County Council, Public Health Department.  Pharmacies already delivering this service should note that there is no obligation under the NHS Contractual Framework to make a supply against a NRT voucher. Pharmacies should also note that the 90p reimbursement per item is less than the NHS Single Activity Fee (currently set at £1.29 per item) and involves additional work submitting a claim via the Northumberland County Council web portal.  As seen from the Newcastle and North Tyneside service specifications, they pay a £2.00 fee per item for supply against a NRT voucher.  Most clients would receive two NRT items per voucher so a prescription would generate £2.58 in activity fee and other areas would pay £4 against a £1.80 fee offered by Northumberland County Council.  

As with all commissioned services, contractors should satisfy themselves that the income appropriately covers the costs of delivering the service including training costs and the costs associated with submitting claims.  Contractors can then compare the opportunity costs (e.g. what alternative income could have been received, but was given up, by choosing to deliver another service) and then decide whether to participate in a service or focus on other activity such as MURs, NMSs, flu vaccinations etc.
