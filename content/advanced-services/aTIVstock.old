# Information on what to do if aTIV is not available  

A [PSNC Briefing](https://psnc.org.uk/services-commissioning/psnc-briefings-services-and-commissioning/psnc-briefing-050-18-flu-vaccination-service-2018-19-adjuvanted-trivalent-inactivated-influenza-vaccine-ativ/) 
explains what pharmacy contractors should do if they have no aTIV available, either 
temporarily or because they have been unable to obtain any aTIV for the 2018/19 flu season.  

## Action to take where a pharmacy has temporarily run out of aTIV  

If a pharmacy is awaiting further supplies of aTIV, from their expected deliveries in October and November, patients
aged 65 and over should be encouraged to return when those supplies become available. If the patient wants to be
vaccinated immediately, they should be referred to their GP practice (if they have aTIV in stock) or another local
pharmacy that has stock available.  

If a GP practice has temporarily run out of aTIV, they are likewise being advised by NHS England to ask patients to
return for vaccination when stocks become available, or they may refer patients to local pharmacies that have stock
available.  

## Action to take where a pharmacy will not receive any aTIV  

Where a pharmacy has not been able to obtain aTIV, they should direct patients to a locally available source of aTIV
at their GP practice or another local pharmacy that has stock available.  

## What happens where GP practices will not receive any aTIV?  

NHS England local teams, together with local public health commissioning teams, are working with CCGs to
coordinate local plans for vaccination of patients where there are GP practices that will not receive any aTIV. In this 
circumstance, NHS England is advising that the GP practice should work closely with local pharmacies to direct
patients to contractors that have aTIV in stock and that are able to vaccinate patients. **In this circumstance, the
practice issuing prescriptions for aTIV would not be appropriate**.  

## Exceptional use of QIV for patients 65 years and over  

Only if there is no locally accessible supply of aTIV, and no further supplies are expected, would it be clinically
appropriate to offer QIV to patients 65 years and over; this is only likely to occur in late November.


# Current aTIV Stock Levels  

In order to facilitate the above guidance, community pharmacy contractors are requested to regularly submit their aTIV stock levels 
using the form link in our PharmOutcomes message.  This will automatically update the table below and allow GPs and other pharmacies to direct 
patients to locations where stock is available.  If there are any further changes required to this table, please email [lpc@northoftynelpc.com](Mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com)
