We have been advised that Public Health England is unable to take bulk orders for Stoptober Pharmacy materials this year. 
Instead, pharmacies are to order their own resources directly from either the [CRC](https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/…/cam…/6/resources/4010
) or the Pharmacy orderline: 0300 123 1019.  

These resources can be ordered now.
