If you have applied for a shared NHSmail account, but have not yet had one allocated to your pharmacy, 
it is important that you act now. 

NHS Digital emailed those affected in the last few weeks to explain how to get 
their account set up. A [PSNC Briefing]{https://ow.ly/4rS430erWJO} has been created to help guide you through the process.
