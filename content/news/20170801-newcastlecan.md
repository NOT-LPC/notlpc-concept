###Why not create a team for your pharmacy?

Molineux Pharmacy, Shields Road Pharmacy and Newcastle Hospitals Pharmacy all have teams for their staff and patients.

To create a team is simple. One person just needs to log on at [www.newcastlecan.com](https://www.newcastlecan.com) and then once logged in, select the teams tab and create a team. Team members can then either find the team by logging on themselves and searching for it, or they you can email them from within the system asking them to join! #NewcastleCan
