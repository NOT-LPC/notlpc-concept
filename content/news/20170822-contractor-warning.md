PSNC has been notified that some community pharmacy contractors have recently been called by individuals 
falsely claiming to be from the NHSBSA investigations team. The unsolicited callers are quoting the ODS code (F code) 
and other pharmacy details when calling and they are stating that there has been a problem with payments to the pharmacy. 
They have then gone on to request personal/business details from the pharmacy contractor, such as 
their mobile telephone number, date of birth, address and business bank account details.

An initial phone conversation may be followed up by a text message purporting to be from the contractor’s bank, 
asking the contractor to call a specific phone number. If this number is called, it provides another opportunity 
for the individuals to obtain details which they can use to access the contractor’s business bank account.

The NHSBSA has confirmed that no member of its team will ever contact a contractor directly and ask for 
bank account details in this way. If you receive such a call, do not provide any personal or bank details and 
report the call to the National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre, 
[Action Fraud](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud), on [0300 123 2040](Tel:03001232040).

If you are ever concerned about the legitimacy of a call purporting to be from the NHSBSA, ask for the name of 
the caller and then tell them that you will call them back; the NHSBSA Prescription Services 
main phone number can be found on the back cover of the Drug Tariff – use this number, not any number provided to you by the caller.
