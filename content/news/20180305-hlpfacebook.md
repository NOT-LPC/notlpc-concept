A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) has been created to support
all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.  

This is a closed [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) so members need 
to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public. 

We hope this group will be useful to HLP Leaders and HLP Champions in sharing ideas and advice with each other.  

Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.  Share any successes or failures 
so others can benefit.  The group has a mix of experienced Healthy Living Champions and those yet to
complete the training.  Why not post a question and hopefully one of the experienced users will be able to help.
