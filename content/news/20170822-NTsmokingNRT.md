North Tyneside council has taken the decision, as part of their review of stop smoking services, 
to remove a number of NRT products from the stop smoking service from 1st October, the start date for the new contract. 
The following products will be removed: Niquitin lozenges, Nicorette inhalator, Nicorette microtabs and Nicorette Quickmist. 
Clients will still be able to receive dual therapy, in line with NICE guidance.  
 
North Tyneside Council has put a message and a note on the service module on PharmOutcomes, to highlight the impending change. 
Products will be removed from the formulary on 6th October, to allow pharmacies time to input any outstanding vouchers 
prior to the quarterâ€™s invoice being generated.
 
In addition, four pharmacies will not have their contract renewed due to performance levels.
