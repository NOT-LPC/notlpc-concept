# Stay Well Pharmacy Campaign  
## Campaign Resources  

The ‘Stay Well Pharmacy’ campaign was launched by NHS England on 12th February 2018. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the services offered by pharmacies, and to position them as the first place to go to for clinical advice and treatment for minor health concerns, such as coughs, colds and tummy troubles.  

All pharmacies, GP surgeries and dental surgeries should have received the campaign toolkit.  

You can download and/or order further materials free of charge through the [Campaign Resource Centre](https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/73-stay-well-pharmacy/resources).
