# CPRS extended to 31st March 2019  

The Community Pharmacy Referral Service (CPRS) which is part of the national Digital Minor Illness Referral Service (DMIRS) is to be continued for the full financial year to the 31st March 2019.

CPRS is still available to [sign up via the NHSBSA website](http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/CPRSnortheast)and over 370 pharmacies across the North East have now registered.  We hope that all pharmacy contractors able to meet the service requirements, and, not yet signed up,  will consider supporting this service that will reduce the burden on NHS urgent and emergency care services for patients requiring low acuity advice and treatment over the forthcoming winter period.

As with all services, contractors are advised to [read the service specification](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2017-12/CPRS%20SLA%20FINAL.pdf) and make themselves familiar with the terms and conditions before agreeing to the service.
