Contractors who only partly edited or validated their NHS Choices profile to meet the gateway criterion for the April review point, 
have been emailed by the NHS Business Services Authority. All three sections must be edited or validated by 10th September 2017 
or there will be a risk that the Quality Payment made for April will need to be recovered.  

Following the declaration period for the April 2017 Quality Payments Scheme closing, NHS England has been working with NHS BSA to 
validate or verify contractors’ declarations for the gateway criteria.
The first part of this process has involved NHS Digital providing a list of contractors who only partly edited or validated 
their NHS Choices profiles, for example, they only edited or validated one or two of the three sections of their 
profiles instead of the required three sections. It is important that all three sections are up to date to ensure 
that patients and the public can access information on NHS Choices that they may require about a pharmacy.
Contractors on this list have received an email from NHS BSA today which will advise that they have until 
10th September 2017 to edit or validate any sections of their NHS Choices profile that they failed to edit 
or validate by 28th April 2017, which was the deadline for meeting the NHS Choices gateway criterion.
Contractors are advised to check their junk/clutter folder in case the email goes into this folder.
If contractors do not edit or validate the outstanding sections by 10th September 2017 they will NOT 
meet the gateway criterion and there will be a risk that the Quality Payment already made for the April review 
point will need to be recovered.

**Important information for the November review point**

Please note, contractors will not be given a ‘second chance’ to edit or validate their NHS Choices profile following the 
November 2017 review point like they are being given for the April review point. It is therefore imperative that for 
the November review point, contractors edit or validate all THREE sections of their NHS Choices profile or they 
will not meet the NHS Choices gateway criterion and will therefore not be entitled to a Quality Payment.
Contractors are required to edit or validate three parts of their NHS Choices profile to meet the gateway 
criterion at the November review point which are:

* their opening hours;
* the facilities the pharmacy provides e.g. consulting room, parking etc; and
* the services the pharmacy provides.
