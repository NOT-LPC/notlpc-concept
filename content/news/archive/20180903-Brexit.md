[DHSC letter](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/735742/Govt_preparations_for_potential_no_deal_-_letter_to_health_and_care_sector.pdf) 
published 23rd August 2018, advises that hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies throughout the UK do not need to 
take any steps to stockpile additional medicines, beyond their business as usual 
stock levels. There is also no need for clinicians to write longer NHS 
prescriptions. Local stockpiling is not necessary and any incidences involving the 
over ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant 
Chief or Responsible Pharmacist directly.

[The DHSC Brexit webpage](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/information-for-the-health-and-care-sector-about-planning-for-a-potential-no-deal-brexit) 
brings together this and other information relevant to pharmacies and other healthcare organisations and it will continue to be updated 
over the coming months.
