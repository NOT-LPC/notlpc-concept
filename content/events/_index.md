North of Tyne Local Pharmaceutical Committee usually meets on the first Wednesday of Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep and Nov. 
Community pharmacy contractors are welcome to observe our [committee meetings](/about/meetings/lpc-meetings.html). 
We also welcome representatives of our stakeholders to meet and present to the committee. 
If you would like to attend a committee meeting, please email [lpc@northoftynelpc.com](mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com).  

We hold three meetings a year in each locality for Healthy Living Champions to network and get updates on health and wellbeing initives. 
We also run frequent training events for pharmacists and pharmacy teams.  

If there is a particular type of event or training evening that you would like us to organise, 
please email your suggestions to [lpc@northoftynelpc.com](mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com).
