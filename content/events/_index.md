North of Tyne LPC holds bi-monthly committee meetings and we we welcome visitors from our stakeholders. 
We also hold regular locality meetings for Healthy Living Champions and frequent training events for pharmacists and pharmacy teams.  

If there is a particular type of event or training evening that you would like us to organise, 
please email your suggestions to {lpc@northoftynelpc.com](mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com)
