**Notes:**  

Gateshead & South Tyneside LPC, Co. Durham and Darlington LPC and North of Tyne LPC have jointly arranged for 
the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) to provide an update on some major topics that are going to have an 
impact on Pharmacy and Pharmacists.  

The meetings will cover:  

1. **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulations. What is GDPR and when will it be implemented?
2. **FMD** - Falsified Medicines Directives. What is FMD, when will it be implemented and what are pharmacies required to do?
3. **Revalidation** - What is the new framework, who is affected and when will it be implemented?

We have arranged 2 venues on 2 different dates. One in the North and one in the South of the area. 
You are welcome to attend whichever meeting is most convenient for you. Both meetings will be the same.
