**Notes:**  

This is the second meeting designed by North of Tyne LPC to provide ongoing support to Health Champions working in community pharmacies. Please note the change of start time to 10am based on the feedback provided at the first meeting.  

As many pharmacies are currently working towards their HLP status as part of the Quality Payment scheme, some staff may not yet have qualified as Health Champions. This meeting is open to those staff who will be or are currently training to be Health Champions. The only restriction, to keep the meeting managable, is that each pharmacy should send no more than ONE representative to the meeting. Those attending will be expected to cascade the information to other pharmacy staff.  

This meeting will be attended by the Learning Disabilities forum and Cancer Research UK. Don't forget to bring a bag to take away the resources and marketing materials which will be available for you.  

A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) has been created to support
all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.  

This is a closed [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) so members need 
to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.  

Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.  Share any successes or failures 
so others can benefit.  The group has a mix of experienced Healthy Living Champions and those yet to
complete the training.  Why not post a question and hopefully one of the experienced users will be able to help.
