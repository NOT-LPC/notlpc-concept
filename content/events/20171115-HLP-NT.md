Please let us knnow if you would like anything added to the agenda.

A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) has been created to support
all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.  

This is a closed [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) so members need 
to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.  

Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.  Share any successes or failures 
so others can benefit.  The group has a mix of experienced Healthy Living Champions and those yet to
complete the training.  Why not post a question and hopefully one of the experienced users will be able to help.
