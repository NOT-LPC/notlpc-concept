<b>Notes:</b>

The first North Tyneside Health Champions meeting is now confirmed for Wednesday 19th July, 12:00 - 2pm in the council chamber, North Tyneside Council, Quadrant, Cobalt Business Park, NE27 0BY. We hope to see all pharmacies represented at the meeting, as you work towards or maintain your status as, a Healthy Living Pharmacy.<br>
To keep the meeting manageable, we ask that only one person per pharmacy attends the meeting. Places can be booked for those already qualified as Health Champions or those intending to become Health Champions.<br>
Meetings will take place every four months, i.e. three per year to provide support and networking opportunities for Health Champions.<br>
More information is available on the Eventbrite booking page.
