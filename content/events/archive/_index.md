North of Tyne Local Pharmaceutical Committee usually meets on the first Wednesday of Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep and Nov. 
Community pharmacy contractors are welcome to observe our [committee meetings](/about/our-meetings.html). 
We invite representatives of our stakeholders to meet and present to the committee. 
If you would like to attend a committee meeting, please email [lpc@northoftynelpc.com](mailto:lpc@northoftynelpc.com).  

We hold three meetings a year in each locality for Healthy Living Champions to network and get updates on health and wellbeing iniatives. 
We also run frequent training events for pharmacists and pharmacy teams.
