**Notes:**  

The next Northumberland Health Champion meeting will take place on Wednesday 19th September at 10am and as usual, at Choppington Social Welfare Centre.  

We are very pleased to have Kate Whitehead from Northumberland Carers coming to speak to you. It is all too easy for carers to be so concerned about the person they are looking after, that they neglect their own health and wellbeing. Kate will provide an overview of the pressures of being a carer and explain the support and services available to them.  

Don't forget, carers are one of the target groups for flu vaccination, so think about how you can support this group to get their vaccination, protecting both themselves and the person they care for.  

This meeting is for all Northumberland community pharmacies accredited as Healthy Living Pharmacies (HLP) or working towards HLP accreditation.  

This meeting is open to those staff who will be or are currently training to be Health Champions. The only restriction, to keep the meeting managable, is that each pharmacy should send no more than ONE representative to the meeting. Those attending will be expected to cascade the information to other pharmacy staff.  

Meetings will take place every four months, i.e. three meetings per year. They will take place on the third Wednesday of the month in January, May and September.  

A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) has been created to support
all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.  

This is a closed [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) so members need 
to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.  

Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.  Share any successes or failures 
so others can benefit.  The group has a mix of experienced Healthy Living Champions and those yet to
complete the training.  Why not post a question and hopefully one of the experienced users will be able to help.
