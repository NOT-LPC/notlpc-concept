**Date:**  Wednesday 17th January  

**Time:**  10.00 â€“ 12.00  

**Location:**  -  Choppington Social Welfare Centre, NE62 5SS

**Registration:**  -  

**Refreshments:**  -  Costs for tea and coffee will be covered by the LPC

**Notes:**  

This meeting is for all Northumberland community pharmacies accredited as Healthy Living Pharmacies (HLP) or working towards HLP accreditation.  

As many pharmacies are currently working towards their HLP status as part of the Quality Payment scheme, some staff may not yet have qualified as Health Champions. This meeting is open to those staff who will be or are currently training to be Health Champions. The only restriction, to keep the meeting managable, is that each pharmacy should send no more than ONE representative to the meeting. Those attending will be expected to cascade the information to other pharmacy staff.  

Meetings will take place every four months, i.e. three meetings per year. They will take place on the third Wednesday of the month in January, May and Sept.  

A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) has been created to support
all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.  

This is a closed [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NOTHLPS/) so members need 
to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.  

Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.  Share any successes or failures 
so others can benefit.  The group has a mix of experienced Healthy Living Champions and those yet to
complete the training.  Why not post a question and hopefully one of the experienced users will be able to help.
