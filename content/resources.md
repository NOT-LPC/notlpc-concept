This page provides quick links to information on local and national services; the pharmacy contractual framework; pharmacy IT; 
training and support; and, other important resources of benefit to community pharmacies.  

Further resources are available on the [PSNC website](http://psnc.org.uk/) and we have linked to that where relevant. 
Use the quicklink in our menu bar to access their website.  

We also recommend that all community pharmacy contractors [register for the PSNC newsletter](https://psnc.org.uk/latest-news/email-sign-up/) which contains updates from their site, providing subscribers with details and links to the most relevant news articles. The newsletter covers a range of topics relating to NHS community pharmacy such as changes to contractual requirements, Drug Tariff updates and funding arrangements, as well as updates to the wider healthcare landscape. Those signed up to this list also receive [price concession alerts and updates](https://psnc.org.uk/dispensing-supply/supply-chain/generic-shortages/).

If you feel there are any ommissions or errors please [contact us](/contact/) with your suggestions and we will do our best to update and improve these resources.
