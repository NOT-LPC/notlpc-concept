      <description>Earlier this year, NHS England wrote to community pharmacy contractors and general practices to advise them that for the 2018&amp;frasl;19 flu vaccination campaign, adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) (Fluad, Seqirus) should be offered to all those aged 65 and over, whilst adults aged under 65 in clinical at-risk groups should be offered a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV).
Seqirus, the manufacturer of aTIV has confirmed to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England that they can supply enough vaccine for the population aged 65 years and over in the UK.</description>
