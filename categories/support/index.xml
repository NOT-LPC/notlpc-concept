      <description>A Facebook Group has been created to support all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.
This is a closed Facebook Group so members need to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.
We hope this group will be useful to HLP Leaders and HLP Champions in sharing ideas and advice with each other.
Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.</description>

      <description>On 1st February 2018 NHS England published updated Approved Particulars relating to:
 Information Governance;
 the Medicines Use Review service;
 the Patient Satisfaction Survey;
 the Pharmacy Practice Leaflet; and
 Premises.
  There are no significant changes compared to the previous Approved Particulars and no actions are required by community pharmacy contractors except for those relating to the Pharmacy Practice Leaflet.
The Pharmacy Practice Leaflet Approved Particulars have been updated to reflect changes to NHS structures and guidance on use of the NHS identity; the updated requirements for leaflets no longer refer to Primary Care Trusts or NHS Direct instead referring to NHS England and NHS 111.</description>
