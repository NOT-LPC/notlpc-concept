      <description>DHSC letter published 23rd August 2018, advises that hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies throughout the UK do not need to take any steps to stockpile additional medicines, beyond their business as usual stock levels. There is also no need for clinicians to write longer NHS prescriptions. Local stockpiling is not necessary and any incidences involving the over ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant Chief or Responsible Pharmacist directly.</description>

      <description>Court of Appeal upholds High Court decision on pharmacy funding cuts The LPC is disappointed to report that the Court of Appeal has today upheld the High Court ruling that the reduction in funding imposed on community pharmacies in October 2016 was not unlawful.
This means that the current community pharmacy funding arrangements will remain in place pending negotiations with PSNC for this financial year and beyond.
PSNC and the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) both brought Judicial Review cases following the Secretary of State’s decision to impose funding reductions on community pharmacies in October 2016.</description>

      <description>CPRS extended to 31st March 2019 The Community Pharmacy Referral Service (CPRS) which is part of the national Digital Minor Illness Referral Service (DMIRS) is to be continued for the full financial year to the 31st March 2019.
CPRS is still available to sign up via the NHSBSA websiteand over 370 pharmacies across the North East have now registered. We hope that all pharmacy contractors able to meet the service requirements, and, not yet signed up, will consider supporting this service that will reduce the burden on NHS urgent and emergency care services for patients requiring low acuity advice and treatment over the forthcoming winter period.</description>

      <description>Category M reimbursement prices will increase by £15 million a month from August 2018, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has confirmed.
The increase is because DHSC has agreed to cease the £15 million per month reduction in prices that had been in place to recover estimated excess margin delivered to pharmacies in 2015&amp;frasl;16 and 2016&amp;frasl;17.
These reductions had been in place since August 2017 and had been set to continue.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, NHS England wrote to community pharmacy contractors and general practices to advise them that for the 2018&amp;frasl;19 flu vaccination campaign, adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) (Fluad, Seqirus) should be offered to all those aged 65 and over, whilst adults aged under 65 in clinical at-risk groups should be offered a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV).
Seqirus, the manufacturer of aTIV has confirmed to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England that they can supply enough vaccine for the population aged 65 years and over in the UK.</description>
