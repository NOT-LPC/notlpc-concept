      <description>On 1st February 2018 NHS England published updated Approved Particulars relating to:
 Information Governance;
 the Medicines Use Review service;
 the Patient Satisfaction Survey;
 the Pharmacy Practice Leaflet; and
 Premises.
  There are no significant changes compared to the previous Approved Particulars and no actions are required by community pharmacy contractors except for those relating to the Pharmacy Practice Leaflet.
The Pharmacy Practice Leaflet Approved Particulars have been updated to reflect changes to NHS structures and guidance on use of the NHS identity; the updated requirements for leaflets no longer refer to Primary Care Trusts or NHS Direct instead referring to NHS England and NHS 111.</description>
