      <description>Following our AGM on the 5th September 2018, we presented the North of Tyne LPC Community Pharmacy Awards 2018
We had a lot of very strong entries that highlighted the excellent work done by community pharmacy in our region and we would like to thank everyone who entered and those who attended to support the winners.
The awards were presented by Simon Dukes, Chief Executive Officer, PSNC who also gave a very inspiring talk on his vision for community pharmacy.</description>
