      <description>Category M reimbursement prices will increase by £15 million a month from August 2018, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has confirmed.
The increase is because DHSC has agreed to cease the £15 million per month reduction in prices that had been in place to recover estimated excess margin delivered to pharmacies in 2015&amp;frasl;16 and 2016&amp;frasl;17.
These reductions had been in place since August 2017 and had been set to continue.</description>
