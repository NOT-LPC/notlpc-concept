      <description>Community pharmacy contractors are welcome to observe our meetings.
Typically, we review progress with local commissioning, receive guests from Area Teams and other NHS and Local Authority personnel, consider new local services opportunities, deal with contract applications, discuss the progress of work carried out by the LPC Chief Officer, review the budget and management accounts, review the business plan, deal with local issues affecting contractors or matters referred to the LPC by contractors.</description>
