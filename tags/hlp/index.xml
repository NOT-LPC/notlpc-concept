      <description>We have been advised that Public Health England is unable to take bulk orders for Stoptober Pharmacy materials this year. Instead, pharmacies are to order their own resources directly from either the CRC or the Pharmacy orderline: 0300 123 1019.
These resources can be ordered now.</description>

      <description>A Facebook Group has been created to support all Healthy Living Pharmacies in the North of Tyne region.
This is a closed Facebook Group so members need to be approved by LPC staff and posts are not visible to the public.
We hope this group will be useful to HLP Leaders and HLP Champions in sharing ideas and advice with each other.
Please post images of your Health Promotion Zone to inspire others.</description>

      <description>Stay Well Pharmacy Campaign Campaign Resources The ‘Stay Well Pharmacy’ campaign was launched by NHS England on 12th February 2018. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the services offered by pharmacies, and to position them as the first place to go to for clinical advice and treatment for minor health concerns, such as coughs, colds and tummy troubles.
All pharmacies, GP surgeries and dental surgeries should have received the campaign toolkit.</description>
