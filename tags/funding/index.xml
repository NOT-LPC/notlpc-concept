      <description>Court of Appeal upholds High Court decision on pharmacy funding cuts The LPC is disappointed to report that the Court of Appeal has today upheld the High Court ruling that the reduction in funding imposed on community pharmacies in October 2016 was not unlawful.
This means that the current community pharmacy funding arrangements will remain in place pending negotiations with PSNC for this financial year and beyond.
PSNC and the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) both brought Judicial Review cases following the Secretary of Stateâ€™s decision to impose funding reductions on community pharmacies in October 2016.</description>
